"""State — scope-aware wrapper around a user-owned payload.

Every :meth:`Flow.run` wraps its incoming state as a :class:`State`; sub-flows
opened with ``state=`` on ``.call`` / ``.loop`` / ``.map`` produce a child
:class:`State` whose ``_parent`` links back to the enclosing scope. Verbs
access their scope's payload via :attr:`data` and reach run-wide state via
:meth:`root`.

The payload is user-owned and opaque to the framework — dict, dataclass,
Pydantic model, arbitrary object. The framework wraps but never inspects.
